# Enterprise AI Support Agent

Enterprise AI Support Agent is an auditable IT support decision-support PoC. It will retrieve relevant knowledge, propose grounded responses and next actions, evaluate risk, and hold actions for human approval.

Phase 2 provides the FastAPI foundation plus strict domain models for incident intake, knowledge evidence, recommendation, evaluation, and human approval. It intentionally does not implement retrieval or the `/assist` workflow yet.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or later

## Setup with uv

```bash
uv python install 3.12
uv sync --extra dev
```

Optional local configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

No API key is required for Phase 1.

## Run

```bash
uv run uvicorn support_agent.main:app --reload
```

Open the API documentation at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs> or verify health:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "Enterprise AI Support Agent",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "environment": "development"
}
```

## Test and lint

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
```

The empty `adapters`, `domain`, and `services` packages are intentional architecture boundaries for later phases.

## Implemented phases

### Phase 1 — Application foundation

- [x] Installable `src`-layout Python project
- [x] FastAPI application factory
- [x] `GET /health`
- [x] Typed health response
- [x] Automated health and OpenAPI tests
- [x] API-key-free startup
- [x] Reproducible setup, run, test, and lint commands

### Phase 2 — Domain model

- [x] Strict incident intake and classification models
- [x] Knowledge lifecycle and evidence models
- [x] Recommendation and explicit abstention models
- [x] Evaluation signals
- [x] Human approval audit metadata
- [x] Aggregate `AssistResponse`
- [x] Cross-model grounding and confidence invariants
- [x] Automated validation tests

## Next phase

Phase 3 will add fictional JSON incident and knowledge datasets, including successful, ambiguous, insufficient-context, missing-knowledge, stale-knowledge, and high-risk cases.
